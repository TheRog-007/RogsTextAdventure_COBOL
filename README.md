Original remit:
Create a simple 80s style text adventure that runs in a console, then translate it into
as many console supporting languages as possible to show my flexibility and knowledge
of programming languages.

Originally done in VB .NET it was converted too:
- C#
- Delphi
- COBOL (!!)

As a tech demo it is currently limited to movement only via simple commands such as: move north
Required some utilities to be written especially for converting the level file into a COBOL
friendly format.

Why no C++ version? Well because C# is basically in many ways the same! (Might do it later on..)

This was the hardest to do in many ways as .Net concepts like lists do not exist, classes are not
fully suppored and not supported at all by OpenCOBOLIDe!

Was a nice challenge :)
